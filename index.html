                My is Tyler Stewart, I'm 24(Almost 25) years old! I was born in Roosvelt, Utah. Some of my hobbies include all things outdoors, shooting, camping, boating/kayaking. 
                I just bought my first home in Murray, Utah. I work for as company named Cookie Composites building skydiving equipment, mostly helmets. 
                I own 5 birds! One Green-Cheek Conure, 2 Cockatiels, and 2 Indian-Ringnecks. I'm Engaged(newly) to my beautiful Fianc√©e, whom I've been dating for 3 years this October. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I grew up in Vernal, Utah up until I moved to Reno, Nevada where I lived until age 15 when I moved back to Salt Lake City. I've lived here ever since and I have enjoyed my time here. 
                I do plan on moving away and travelling the world once I'm able!
